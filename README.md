# roCMD Documentation and Usage Guide
### What is roCMD?
roCMD is a CLI, or command-based terminal, which allows users to retrieve information of creations throughout the ROBLOX platform. It uses python (.py), which is one of the leading languages in the world. 

### What is Python?
Python is a general-purpose coding languageâ€”which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.

### Hows it made?
I am using a module known as pyrblx (https://pypi.org/project/pyrblx/) to use ROBLOX Api's. Although the module does not cover all bases of ROBLOX api, it still works fine as is. In future updates, I will be rewriting pyrblx to suit a more diverse set of options in roCMD>

### Planned updates
* More Commands for Information (assets, catalog, search, games, avatar) | NOT YET COMPLETE
* Control Roblox, etc control roles in groups, games, and cover as many API endpoints as possible. | NOT YET COMPLETE
* Make a Discord Bot version of roCMD.

### Usage
I have made this as easy as possible. 

After downloading the rocmd-master.zip, please unzip it to your preferred location. 

Now, to run the program, open the folder and navigate to the folder named 'roCMD'. 

Finally, run 'roCMD_batchRun.bat' and follow the steps from there. If you wish to alter or edit the files, please navigate to the folder named 'src' and edit index.py.

If any issues come up, feel free to report them.
